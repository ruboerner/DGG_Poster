# Introduction

This is the `posterdown_betterport` template for the {posterdown} package! I was inspired by the twitter thread of [Mike Morrison](https://mobile.twitter.com/mikemorrison/status/1110191245035479041) and wanted to apply the `#betterposter` concept to the reproducible (yet simple to use) functionality of the {posterdown} package [@R-posterdown]. If you're not an R user don't sweat as you do **NOT** need to use it at all! Feel free to use only the Markdown functionality of this package :)

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::write_bib(c('posterdown', 'rmarkdown','pagedown'), 'packages.bib')
```

# Objectives

1.  Pick a template layout.
2.  Write/ create your poster content distraction free.
3.  Let posterdown do its thing!

```{r, out.width="120px", echo=FALSE}
library(qrcode)
code <- qr_code('http://tu-freiberg.de')
plot(code, col = c("white", "#00477e"))
```

# Methods

I will show here how to include poster elements that may be useful, such as equation using mathjax:
$$
E = mc^2 
$$
To reference a citation you can add your `.bib` file to the working directory and name it in the YAML metadata or generate an automated one as done here, then you only need to reference the label value in the `.bib` file. For example this package is built on top of the wonderful {pagedown} package and I will cite it at the end of this sentence using this in the rmd `[@R-pagedown]` [@R-pagedown].

To get a better understanding of how to include features like these please refer to the {posterdown} [wiki](https://github.com/posterdown/wiki).

***Now on to the results!***
